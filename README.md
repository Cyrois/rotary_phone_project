#rotary_phone_project

I had an old rotary phone that was going to be tossed out, so I had a funny idea that came to mind...phone sex...

The idea was that I ripped out the guts of the phone, everything but the speaker.

I got my python script ready to play a soundbite on loop and loaded the script onto a raspberry pi.

Then I toyed around with the wires quite a bit until I figured out the how the power the speaker and how to send data to it.

Once I got the hardware working, I needed to disable the gui on the pi and have it execute the py script on startup.

I set up an ssh tunnel on the pi to make it easier to access it.

Then put everything inside the phone and passed the phone around to some friends.
